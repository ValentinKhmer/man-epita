# Anglophone Section

The **Anglophone Section** is an English-taught track available at EPITA for
students in SUP, SPE, and ING1. It offers the same curriculum as the francophone
section, but delivered entirely in English.

## Key Differences

### Course Delivery

- All lectures and coursework are conducted in English.
- Exceptions include certain modules NTS ("Nouvelles Technologies et Société")
videos, that are still taught in French.

### Assessments

- MCQs and exams follow the same structure as the francophone section but are
translated into English.

### Prépa Specifics

- In the prepa years, instead of watching
[**Mimos**](/docs/school/prepa/mimos.md) like students in francophone section,
anglophone students follow traditional lecture-based CMs (*Cours Magistraux*).  
  However, these CMs are not mandatory and students still have access to the
**Mimos** if they prefer, though they are in French.
