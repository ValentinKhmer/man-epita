## 2nd year (SPE)

:::warning
Since the Programmation program changed for the **2030 promo**, this section is
**SUBJECT TO CHANGE**!
:::

These activities take place during the **first week** of SPE. Each day includes
one Programming lecture (CM) and one graded practical session. A programming
exam is scheduled the following week to verify that students have understood the
main concepts.

The goal of this seminary is to discover the C programming language and learn
the basics.
