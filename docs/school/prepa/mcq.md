## Rules

## The grading system

During the MCQs, each subject receives an independent grade out of 20. The
grading is as follows:

A **correct answer** awards ***2 points***.

A **wrong answer** deducts ***1 point***.

An **empty or incomplete answer** neither awards nor deducts points (***0
points***).
